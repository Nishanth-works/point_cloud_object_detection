## ðŸš€ PointNet: A High-Performance, Memory-Optimised Object Detection and Classification Model for Point Clouds ðŸš€

This repository contains an implementation of the PointNet model for object detection and classification in point clouds. The model is trained on a dataset of 3D point clouds of objects from various categories, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. The code is optimized for memory and includes several features such as data augmentation, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling.

In this README, you will find instructions for running the code, details on the model architecture and optimization techniques used, and performance metrics on test datasets.

PointNet, a deep learning architecture for object classification in point cloud data. PointNet is a neural network that takes as input a set of points, represented as (x, y, z) coordinates, and outputs a probability distribution over a set of object classes.

This implementation uses TensorFlow 2 to train and evaluate the model on the ModelNet10 dataset, which consists of approximately 4000 point clouds per class. The training data is augmented with random rotations, scaling, and jittering to increase the robustness of the model.

### Requirements
To run this code, you will need the following packages:

- `numpy`
- `open3d`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

### You can install these packages using pip by running the command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
To train the PointNet model on the ModelNet10 dataset, run the following command:


`python train.py`

This will train the model for 100 epochs and save the best weights to a file called pointnet_weights.h5.

### To evaluate the model on the test set, run the following command:


`python test.py`

This will load the saved weights and evaluate the model on the test set, printing the test loss, test accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Implementation Details

This implementation of PointNet consists of the following files:

- `train.py`: Script to train the PointNet model on the ModelNet10 dataset.
- `test.py`: Script to evaluate the PointNet model on the test set.
- `pointnet.py`: Module defining the PointNet model architecture.
- data/: Directory containing the ModelNet10 dataset in the form of point cloud files (*.ply) and label files (*.npy).
- The PointNet model architecture consists of several fully connected layers followed by a max pooling layer and several more fully connected layers. The input to the model is a set of (x, y, z) coordinates representing a point cloud, and the output is a probability distribution over the 10 object classes in the ModelNet10 dataset.

The training data is augmented with random rotations, scaling, and jittering to increase the robustness of the model. The model is trained using a generator to load and preprocess data in batches, and the learning rate is adjusted during training using a learning rate schedule.

### Optimizations

To optimize the performance and memory usage of the model, several techniques were employed:

- Voxel downsampling: The point cloud is downsampled using a voxel grid to reduce the number of points in the input.
Batching and generators: The model is trained using a generator to load and preprocess data in batches, which reduces the memory usage and allows for training on large datasets.
Early stopping: Training is stopped early if the validation loss does not improve for a specified number of epochs, which reduces the risk of overfitting and improves training efficiency.
- Learning rate schedule: The learning rate is adjusted during training using a schedule to improve convergence and reduce the risk of getting stuck in local minima.

### Results
After training for 100 epochs, the PointNet model achieved a test accuracy of 87.2% on the ModelNet10 dataset. The confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score are also printed during evaluation.
